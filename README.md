# VRM (Vue Route Modal)
VRM (Vue Route Modal) is a package that manages modals using routes. 

By leveraging `vue-router`, it opens or closes modals when navigating to or from specific paths in a web application. Additionally, it allows for the transmission of complex data beyond just route parameters.

> [!WARNING] This package is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. But you can clone the repository and test it out for yourself.
