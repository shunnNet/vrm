# VRM (Vue Route Modal)
VRM (Vue Route Modal) is a package that manages modals using routes. 

By leveraging `vue-router`, it opens or closes modals when navigating to or from specific paths in a web application. Additionally, it allows for the transmission of complex data beyond just route parameters.

> [!WARNING] This package is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. But you can clone the repository and test it out for yourself.

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:shunnNet/vrm.git

# install
pnpm install

# run
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You can find some links and buttons to test the package.

## TODO:
- [ ] Still some issues
- [ ] Implement hash modal for global modals
